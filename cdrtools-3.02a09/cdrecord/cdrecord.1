.TH CDRECORD 1 "Version 3.02 2017/09/21" "J\*org Schilling" "Schily\'s USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
cdrecord \- record audio or data CD, DVD or BluRay
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cdrecord
[
.I "general options
][
.BI dev= device
][
.I track options
]
.IR track1 .\|.\|. trackn

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Cdrecord
is used to record data or audio Compact Discs on an Orange Book
CD-recorder, to write DVD media on a DVD-recorder or to write
BluRay media on a BluRay-recorder.
.PP
.SS "Device naming"
Most users do not need to care about device naming at all.
If no
.B dev=
option was specified, 
.B cdrecord
implements 
.B auto target
support and automagically finds the drive in case that exactly
one CD-ROM type drive is available in the system.
In case that more than one CD-ROM type drive exists on the system,
a list of possible device name parameters may be retrieved with
.B "cdrecord \-scanbus
or from the target example from the output of
.BR "cdrecord dev=help" ,
then the
.B dev=
parameter may be set based on the device listing.
.PP
The
.I device
parameter to the
.B dev=
option
explained below refers to the
.B SCSI\ CAM
standard notation for
.IR scsibus / target / lun
of the CD/DVD/BluRay-recorder.
If a file /etc/default/cdrecord exists, the parameter to the
.B dev=
option may also be a drive name label in said file (see FILES section).

.ne 6
.SS "Constraints for running cdrecord"
.PP
On 
.B SVr4 
compliant systems, 
.B cdrecord 
uses the real-time class to get the highest scheduling priority that is
possible (higher than all kernel processes).
On systems with 
.B POSIX real-time scheduling
cdrecord uses real-time scheduling too, 
but may not be able to gain a priority that is higher than all kernel processes.
.PP
In order to be able to use the SCSI transport subsystem of the OS, run at highest
priority and lock itself into core
.B
cdrecord
either needs to be run as root, needs to be installed suid root or
must be called via a
fine grained privileges mechanism, such as the Solaris
.BR privileges (5)
mechanism via
.BR exec_attr (4)
or the Linux
.BR capabilities (7)
mechanism via
.BR setcap (8)
to allow cdrecord to be used as an ordinary user.

.ne 6
.SS "File to track mapping"
.PP
In 
.I Track At Once 
mode, each
.I track
corresponds to a single file that contains the prepared data for that track.
If the argument is 
.RB ` \- ',
standard input is used for that track. 
Only one track may be taken from 
.IR stdin .
In the other write modes, the direct file to track relation may not be implemented.
In 
.B \-clone
mode, a single file contains all data for the whole disk.
To allow DVD writing on platforms that do not implement large file support,
.B cdrecord
concatenates all file arguments to a single track when writing to DVD media.

.SH "GENERAL OPTIONS
.PP
General options must be before any track file name or track option.
.SS "Informative options"
.TP
.B \-help
display version information for
.B cdrecord
on standard output.
.TP
.B \-version
Print version information and exit.
.TP
.B \-v
Increment the level of general verbosity by one.
This is used e.g. to display the progress of the writing process.
.SS "Media write mode options"
.TP
.B \-dummy
The
.B \-dummy
option modifies the current write strategy.
The CD/DVD/BluRay-recorder will go through all steps of the recording process,
but the laser is turned off during this procedure.
It is recommended to run several tests before actually writing to a 
Compact Disk or Digital Versatile Disk,
if the timing and load response of the current system is not yet known.
.sp
The
.B \-dummy
option does not work with all media and write modes.
DVD+ media and BluRay media does not support
.B dummy
writes and most CD-recorders do not support
.B dummy
writes in raw mode.
.TP
.B \-multi
Allow multi-session CDs or multi-border DVDs to be made. 
This flag needs to be present
on all sessions of a multi-session or multi-border disk,
except you want to create a session on a CD that will be 
the last session on the CD-media.
.sp
For CD-media,
the fixation will be done in a way that allows the CD/DVD/BluRay-recorder to
append additional sessions later. This is done by generating a TOC
with a link to the next program area. The so generated media is not
100% compatible to manufactured CDs (except for CDplus). 
Use only for recording of multi-session CDs.
If this option is present, the default track type is
.BR "CD-ROM XA mode 2 form 1"
and the sector size is 2048 bytes. 
The XA sector subheaders will be created by the drive. 
The 
.I Sony 
drives have no hardware support for 
.BR "CD-ROM XA mode 2 form 1" .
You have to specify the 
.B \-data 
option in order to create multi-session disks on these drives.
If you like to record a multi-session disk in SAO mode,
you need to force 
.B CD-ROM
sectors by including the
.B \-data
option.
Not all drives allow multi-session CDs in SAO mode.
.sp
For DVD media,
.B \-multi
switches the write mode to 
.BR "incremental packet recording" .
There is currently no way to prevent the ability to append further
sessions and there is currently only support for DVD-R/DVD-RW media.
To reuse a DVD-RW that has previously been written in
.B "incremental packet recording"
mode for different write modes, you need to blank the entire media before.
.TP
.B \-dao
.TP
.B \-sao
Set 
.B "SAO (Session At Once)
mode which is usually called
.BR "Disk At Once " mode.
This currently only works with MMC drives that support
.B "Session At Once
mode.
Note that cdrecord needs to know the size of each track in advance for this mode
(see the
.B "mkisofs \-print\-size"
option and the 
.I EXAMPLES
section for more information).
.sp
There are several CD writers with bad firmware
that result in broken disks when writing in TAO or SAO mode.
If you find any problems with the layout of a disk or with subchannel 
content (e.g. wrong times on the display when playing the CD) and your drive
supports to write in 
.B \-raw96r
or
.B \-raw16
mode, you should give it a try.
.TP
.B \-tao
Set
.B "TAO (Track At Once) writing mode.
This is the default write mode in previous
.B cdrecord
versions.
With most drives, this write mode is required for multi-session recording.
.sp
There are several CD writers with bad firmware
that result in broken disks when writing in TAO or SAO mode.
If you find any problems with the layout of a disk or with subchannel 
content (e.g. wrong times on the display when playing the CD) and your drive
supports to write in 
.B \-raw96r
or
.B \-raw16
mode, you should give it a try.
.TP
.B \-raw
Set
.B "RAW writing mode.
Using this option defaults to 
.BR \-raw96r .
Note that cdrecord needs to know the size of each track in advance for this mode
(see the
.B "mkisofs \-print\-size"
option and the 
.I EXAMPLES
section for more information).
.TP
.B \-raw96r
Set
.B "RAW writing mode
with 2352 byte sectors plus 96 bytes of raw P-W sub-channel data resulting
in a sector size of 2448 bytes.
This is the preferred raw writing mode as it gives best control over the
CD-writing process.
Writing data disks in raw mode needs significantly more CPU time than other
write modes. If your CPU is too slow, this may result in buffer underruns.
Note that cdrecord needs to know the size of each track in advance for this mode
(see the
.B "mkisofs \-print\-size"
option and the 
.I EXAMPLES
section for more information).
.TP
.B \-raw96p
Set
.B "RAW writing mode
with 2352 byte sectors plus 96 bytes of packed P-W sub-channel data resulting
in a sector size of 2448 bytes.
This is the less preferred raw writing mode as only a few recorders support
it and some of these recorders have bugs in the firmware implementation.
Don't use this mode if your recorder supports
.B \-raw96r
or
.BR \-raw16 .
Writing data disks in raw mode needs significantly more CPU time than other
write modes. If your CPU is too slow, this may result in buffer underruns.
Note that cdrecord needs to know the size of each track in advance for this mode
(see the
.B "mkisofs \-print\-size"
option and the 
.I EXAMPLES
section for more information).
.TP
.B \-raw16
Set
.B "RAW writing mode
with 2352 byte sectors plus 16 bytes of P-Q sub-channel data resulting
in a sector size of 2368 bytes.
If a recorder does not support 
.BR \-raw96r ,
this is the preferred raw writing mode.
It does not allow to write
.I CD-Text
or
.I CD+Graphics
but it is the only raw writing mode in cheap CD-writers,
as these cheap writers in most cases do not support
.B \-dao
mode.
Don't use this mode if your recorder supports
.BR \-raw96r .
Writing data disks in raw mode needs significantly more CPU time than other
write modes. If your CPU is too slow, this may result in buffer underruns.
Note that cdrecord needs to know the size of each track in advance for this mode
(see the
.B "mkisofs \-print-size"
option and the 
.I EXAMPLES
section for more information).
.SS "Cdrecord functional options"
.TP
.B \-abort
Try to send an 
.B abort
sequence to the drive.
If you use 
.B cdrecord
only, this should never be needed; but other software may leave a drive 
in an unusable condition.
Calling
.B "cdrecord \-reset
may be needed if a previous write has been interrupted and the software did 
not tell the drive that it will not continue to write.
.TP
.B \-atip
Retrieve and print out the ATIP (Absolute Time In Pre-groove) info of a CD/DVD/BluRay
recordable or CD/DVD/BluRay re-writable media.
With this option, 
.B cdrecord
will try to retrieve the ATIP info. If the actual drive does not support
to read the ATIP info, it may be that only a reduced set of information
records or even nothing is displayed. Only a limited number of MMC-compliant
drives support to read the ATIP info.
.sp
If 
.B cdrecord
is able to retrieve the lead-in start time for the first session, it will try to
decode and print the manufacturer info from the media.
DVD media does not have ATIP information but there is equivalent prerecorded
information that is read out and printed.
.TP
.BI blank= type
Blank a CD-RW and exit or blank a CD-RW before writing. The blanking type may be one of:
.RS
.TP 12
help
Display a list of possible blanking types.
.TP
all
Blank the entire disk. This may take a long time.
.TP
fast
Minimally blank the disk. This results in erasing the PMA, the TOC and the pregap.
.TP
track
Blank the last track.
.TP
unreserve
Unreserve a reserved track.
.TP
trtail
Blank the tail of a track.
.TP
unclose
Unclose last session.
.TP
session
Blank the last session.
.PP
Not all drives support all blanking types. It may be necessary to use
.B "blank=all
if a drive reports a specified command as being invalid.
If used together with the 
.B \-force
flag, this option may be used to blank CD-RW disks that otherwise cannot be
blanked. Note that you may need to specify
.BI blank= all
because some drives will not continue with certain types of bad CD-RW
disks. Note also that
.B cdrecord
does its best if the 
.B \-force 
flag is used but it finally depends on the drive's firmware 
whether the blanking operation will succeed or not.
.RE
.TP
.B \-checkdrive
Checks if a driver for the current drive is present and exit.
If the drive is a known drive, 
.B cdrecord
uses exit code 0.
.TP
.B \-clone
Tells 
.B cdrecord
to handle images created by
.IR "readcd \-clone" .
The
.B \-clone
write mode may only be used in conjunction with the
.B \-raw96r
or
.B \-raw16
option.
Using
.B \-clone
together with
.B \-raw96r
is preferred as it allows to write all sub-channel data.
The
.B \-raw16
option should only be used with drives that do not support to write in
.B \-raw96r
mode.
.sp
Note that copying in
.B clone
mode disables certain levels of error correction and thus always results 
in a quality degradation. 
Avoid copying audio CDs in
.B clone
mode for this reason.
.TP
.BI cuefile= filename
Take all recording-related information from a CDRWIN-compliant
.B "CUE sheet
file.
No track-file arguments to 
.B cdrecord
are allowed when this option is present and one of the following options:
.BR \-dao ,
.BR \-sao ,
.BR \-raw ,
.BR \-raw16 ,
.B \-raw96r
is needed in addition.
.TP
.BR defpregap= #
Set the default pre-gap size for all tracks except track number 1.
This option currently only makes sense with the following drives:
.sp
.BR "Teac CD-R50S" , 
.BR "Teac CD-R55S" ,
.BR "JVC XR-W2010" ,
.B Pinnacle RCD-5020
.sp
when
creating track-at-once disks without the 2-second silence before each track.
.br
This option may go away in the future. 
.TP
.BI driver= name
Allows the user to manually select a driver for the device.
The reason for the existence of the
.BI driver= name
option is to allow users to use
.B cdrecord
with drives that are similar to supported drives but not known
directly by
.BR cdrecord .
All drives made after 1997 should be MMC-standard-compliant and
thus supported by one of the MMC drivers.
It is most unlikely that
.B cdrecord
is unable to find the right driver automatically.
Use this option with extreme care. If a wrong driver is used for a
device, the possibility of creating corrupted disks is high.
The minimum problem related to a wrong driver is that the 
.B \-speed
or 
.B \-dummy
will not work.
.br
.RS
.ne 8
.PP
The following driver names are supported:
.TP
.B help
To get a list of possible drivers together with a short description.
.TP
.B mmc_bd
The generic SCSI-3/mmc BluRay driver is auto-selected whenever
.B cdrecord
finds an MMC-compliant drive that does support to write BluRay media or a
multi system that contains a BluRay disk as the current medium.
This driver tries to close the tray, checks the medium found in the tray and then 
branches to the driver that matches the current medium.
.TP
.B mmc_bdr
The generic SCSI-3/mmc BluRay driver is auto-selected whenever
.B cdrecord
finds an MMC-compliant drive that does support to write BluRay BD-R media or a
multi system that contains a BluRay BD-R disk as the current medium.
.TP
.B mmc_bdre
The generic SCSI-3/mmc BluRay driver is auto-selected whenever
.B cdrecord
finds an MMC-compliant drive that does support to write BluRay BD-RE media or a
multi system that contains a BluRay BD-RE disk as the current medium.
.TP
.B mmc_cd
The generic SCSI-3/mmc CD-ROM driver is auto-selected whenever
.B cdrecord
finds an MMC-compliant drive that does not identify itself to support writing at
all, or that only identifies to support media or write modes not implemented in
.BR cdrecord .
.TP
.B mmc_cd_dvd
The generic SCSI-3/mmc CD/DVD/BluRay driver is auto-selected whenever
.B cdrecord
finds an MMC-2 or MMC-3-compliant drive that seems to support more than 
one medium type and the tray is open or no medium could be found to select the
right driver.
This driver tries to close the tray, checks the medium found in the tray and then
branches to the driver that matches the current medium.
.TP
.B mmc_cdr
The generic SCSI-3/mmc CD-R/CD-RW driver is auto-selected whenever
.B cdrecord
finds an MMC-compliant drive that only supports to write CDs or a multi system
drive that contains a CD as the current medium.
.TP
.B mmc_cdr_sony
The generic SCSI-3/mmc CD-R/CD-RW driver is auto-selected whenever
.B cdrecord
would otherwise select the
.B mmc_cdr
driver but the device seems to be made by Sony.
The
.B mmc_cdr_sony
is definitely needed for the Sony CDU 928 as this drive does not completely
implement the MMC standard and some of the MMC SCSI commands have to be
replaced by Sony proprietary commands. It seems that all Sony drives (even
newer ones) still implement the Sony proprietary SCSI commands so it has
not yet become a problem to use this driver for all Sony drives. If you find
a newer Sony drive that does not work with this driver, please report.
.TP
.B mmc_dvd
The generic SCSI-3/mmc-2 DVD-R/DVD-RW driver is auto-selected whenever
.B cdrecord
finds an MMC-2 or MMC-3-compliant drive that supports to write DVDs and
an appropriate medium is loaded.
There is no Track At Once mode for DVD writers.
.TP
.B mmc_dvdplus
The generic SCSI-3/mmc-3 DVD+R/DVD+RW driver is auto-selected whenever
one of the DVD+ media types that are incompatible to each other is found.
It checks media and then 
branches to the driver that matches the current medium.
.TP
.B mmc_dvdplusr
The generic SCSI-3/mmc-3 DVD+R driver is auto-selected whenever
a DVD+R medium is found in an appropriate writer.
Note that for unknown reason, the DVD+RW Alliance does not
like that there is a simulation mode for DVD+R media.
The author of
.B cdrecord
tries to convince manufacturers to implement a simulation mode for DVD+R
and implement support.
DVD+R only supports one write mode that is somewhere between Track At Once
and Packet writing; this mode is selected in 
.B cdrecord
via the 
.BR \-dao / \-sao
option.
.TP
.B mmc_dvdplusrw
The generic SCSI-3/mmc-3 DVD+RW driver is auto-selected whenever
a DVD+RW medium is found in an appropriate writer.
As DVD+RW media need to be formatted before their first use, cdrecord
auto-detects this medium state and performs a format before it starts
to write.
Note that for unknown reason, the DVD+RW Alliance does not
like that there is a simulation mode nor a way to erase DVD+RW media.
DVD+RW only supports one write mode that is close to
Packet writing; this mode is selected in 
.B cdrecord
via the 
.BR \-dao / \-sao
option.
.TP
.B cw_7501
The driver for Matsushita/Panasonic CW-7501 is auto-selected when
.B cdrecord
finds this old pre-MMC drive.
.B Cdrecord
supports all write modes for this drive type.
.TP
.B kodak_pcd_600
The driver for Kodak PCD-600 is auto-selected when

drive.
All Philips CDD-521 or similar drives (see other drivers in this list)
do not support Session At Once recording.
.TP
.B philips_cdd521_old
The driver for Philips old CDD-521 is auto-selected when
.B cdrecord

.TP
.B philips_cdd522
The driver for Philips CDD-522 is auto-selected when
.B cdrecord

The driver for Teac CD-R50S, Teac CD-R55S, JVC XR-W2010, Pinnacle RCD-5020
is auto-selected whenever one of the drives is found that is known to use the
non-MMC command set used by TEAC and JVC.
Note that many drives from JVC will not work because they do not correctly implement
the documented command set and JVC has been unwilling to fix or document the

The simulation drivers implement a drive with a buffer size of 1\ MB
that can be changed via the 
.B CDR_SIMUL_BUFSIZE
environment variable.
The simulation driver correctly simulates even a buffer underrun condition.
If the 
.B \-dummy 
option is present, the simulation is not aborted in case of a buffer underrun.

.TP
.BI driveropts= "option list"
Set driver specific options. The options are specified as a comma separated list.
To get a list of valid options use 
.BI driveropts= help
together with the 
.I \-checkdrive
option.
If you like to set driver options without running a typical
.B cdrecord
task, you need to use the
.B \-setdropts
option in addition, otherwise the command line parser in
.B cdrecord
will complain.
Currently implemented driver options are:
.RS
.TP
.B burnfree 
Turn the support for Buffer Underrun Free writing on.
This only works for drives that support Buffer Underrun Free technology.
This may be called:
.BR "Sanyo BURN-Proof" ,
.BR "Ricoh Just-Link" ,
.B "Yamaha Lossless-Link"
or similar.
.sp
The default is to turn 
.B BURN-Free
off, regardless of the defaults of the drive.
.TP
.B noburnfree 
Turn the support for Buffer Underrun Free writing off.

.BI varirec= value
Turn on the 
.B "Plextor VariRec"
writing mode. The mandatory parameter
.I value
is the laser power offset and currently may be selected from
\-2, \-1, 0, 1, 2.
In addition, you need to set the write speed to 4 in order to allow
.B "VariRec"
to work.
.TP
.BI gigarec= value
Manage the
.B "Plextor GigaRec"
writing mode. The mandatory parameter
.I value
is the disk capacity ratio compared to normal recording and currently may be selected from
0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1,1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4.
If values < 1.0 are used, then the effect is similar to the
.B "Yamaha Audio Master Q. R."
feature. If values > 1.0 are used, then the disk capacity is 
increased.
.sp
Not all drives support all 
.B GigaRec
values.
When a drive uses the 
.B GigaRec
feature, the write speed is limited to 8x.
.TP
.B audiomaster
Turn on the 
.B "Yamaha Audio Master Q. R."
feature which usually should result in high quality CDs that
have less reading problems in Hi-Fi players.
As this is implemented as a variant of the 
Session At Once write mode, it will only work if you select 
SAO write mode and there is no need to turn it off.
The 
.B "Audio Master"
mode will work with a limited speed but
may also be used with data CDs. In
.B "Audio Master"
mode, the pits on the CD will be written larger than usual so the capacity
of the medium is reduced when turning this feature on.
A 74-minute CD will only have a capacity of 63 minutes if
.B "Audio Master"
is active and the capacity of a 80-minute CD will be reduced to 68 minutes,
the capacity in will be reduced to 85% of the original capacity.
On newer Plextor drives, this feature is also present but the capacity
will be reduced to 86.66% of the original capacity. For other factors
on Plextor drives, see the
.B gigarec
option above.
.TP
.B forcespeed
Normally, modern drives know the highest possible speed for different
media and may reduce the speed in order to grant best write quality.
This technology may be called:
.BR "Plextor PowerRec" ,
.BR "Ricoh Just-Speed" ,
.B "Yamaha Optimum Write Speed Control"
or similar.
Some drives (e.g. Plextor, Ricoh and Yamaha) allow to force the drive to
use the selected speed even if the medium is so bad that the
write quality would be poor. This option tells such a drive to
force to use the selected speed regardless of the medium quality.
.sp
Use this option with extreme care and note that the drive should know better
which medium will work at full speed.
The default is to turn 
.B forcespeed
off, regardless of the defaults of the drive.
.TP
.B noforcespeed
Turn off the 
.B "force speed
feature.
.TP
.B speedread
Some ultra high speed drives such as 48x and faster drives from Plextor
limit the read speed for unknown media to e.g. 40x in order to avoid
damaged disks and drives.
Using this option tells the drive to read any media as fast as possible.
Be very careful as this may cause the media to break in the drive 
while reading, resulting in damaged media and drive! 
.TP
.B nospeedread
Turn off unlimited read speed.
.TP
.B singlesession
Turn the drive into a single-session only drive.
This allows to read defective or non-compliant (illegal) media with extremely
non-standard additional (broken/illegal) TOC entries in the TOC from the second
or higher session. Some of these disks become
usable if only the information from the first session is used.
You need to enable Single Session mode before you insert the defective disk!
.TP
.B nosinglesession
Turn off single-session mode. The drive will again behave as usual.
.TP
.B hidecdr
Hide the fact that a medium might be a recordable medium.
This allows to make CD-Rs look like CD-ROMs and applications believe 
that the media in the drive is not a CD-R. 
.TP
.B nohidecdr
Turn off hiding CD-R media.
.TP
.B tattooinfo
Use this option together with
.B \-checkdrive
to retrieve the image size information for the
.B "Yamaha DiskT@2
feature. The images always have a line length of 3744 pixels.
Line number 0 (radius 0) is mapped to the center of the disk.
If you know the inner and outer radii you will be able to create a
pre distorted image that later may appear undistorted on the disk.
.TP
.BI tattoofile= name
Use this option together with
.B \-checkdrive
to write an image prepared for the
.B "Yamaha DiskT@2
feature to the medium.
The file must be a file with raw image B&W data (one byte per pixel) 
in a size as retrieved by a previous call to
.BR tattooinfo .
If the size of the image equals the maximum possible size
(3744 x 320 pixels), 
.B cdrecord
will use the first part of the file. This first part then will 
be written to the leftover space on the CD.
.sp
Note that the image must be mirrored to be readable from the pick up
side of the CD.
.TP
.B layerbreak
Switch a drive with DVD-R/DL medium into 
.B "layer jump recording
recording mode and use automatic layer-break position setup.
.sp
By default, DVD-R/DL media is written in
.B "sequential recording
mode that completely fills up both layers.
.TP
.BI layerbreak= value
Set up a manual layer-break value for DVD-R/DL and DVD+R/DL.
The specified layer-break value must not be set to less than half of the recorded
data size and must not be set to more than the remaining
.I "Layer 0 size
of the medium.
The manual layer-break value needs to be a multiple of the ECC sector
size which is 16 logical 2048 byte sectors in case of DVD media
and 32 logical 2048 byte sectors in case of HD-DVD or BD media.
.sp
.B Cdrecord
does not allow to write DL media in case that the total amount of data is
less then the
.I "Layer 0 size
of the medium except when a manual layer-break has been specified by using the
.BI layerbreak= value
option.
.RE
.TP
.B \-eject
Eject disk after doing the work.
Some devices (e.g. Philips) need to eject the medium before creating a new
disk. Doing a \-dummy test and immediately creating a real disk would not
work on these devices.
.TP
.B \-fix
The disk will only be fixated (i.e. a TOC for a CD-reader will be written). 
This may be used, if for some reason the disk has been written but not
fixated. This option currently does not work with old TEAC drives (CD-R50S and
CD-R55S).
.TP
.B \-force
Force to continue on some errors. Be careful when using this option.
.B Cdrecord
implements several checks that prevent you from doing unwanted things
like damaging CD-RW media by improper drives. Many of the sanity checks are 
disabled when the 
.B \-force
option is used.
.sp
This option also implements some tricks that will allow 
you to blank bad CD-RW disks.
.TP
.B \-format
Format a CD-RW/DVD-RW/DVD+RW/BD-RE disc.
Formatting is currently only implemented for DVD+RW and BD-RE media.
A 'maiden' DVD+RW or BD-RE medium needs to
be formatted before you may write to it.
However, as
.B cdrecord
autodetects the need for formatting in this case and auto formats the medium
before it starts writing, the
.B \-format
option is only needed if you like to forcibly reformat a DVD+RW or BD-RE medium.
.TP
.BR fs= #
Set the FIFO (ring buffer) size to #.
You may use the same syntax as in 
.BR dd (1),
.BR sdd (1)
or
.BR star (1).
The number representing the size is taken in bytes unless otherwise specified.
If a number is followed directly by the letter `b', `k', `m', `s' or `f',
the size is multiplied by 512, 1024, 1024*1024, 2048 or 2352.
If the size consists of numbers separated by `x' or `*', multiplication of the 
two numbers is performed.
Thus 
.I "fs=10x63k
will specify a FIFO size of 630\ kBytes.
.sp
The size specified by the 
.I fs=
argument includes the shared memory that is needed for administration. This
is at least one page of memory.
If no
.IR fs =
option is present, 
.B cdrecord
will try to get the FIFO size value from the 
.B CDR_FIFOSIZE
environment.
The default FIFO size is currently 4 MB.
.sp
The FIFO is used to increase buffering for the real-time writing process.
It allows to run a pipe from 
.B mkisofs
directly into 
.BR cdrecord .
If the FIFO is active and a pipe from 
.B mkisofs
into 
.B cdrecord
is used to create a CD, 
.B cdrecord
will abort prior to do any modifications on the disk if 
.B mkisofs 
dies before writing starts.
The recommended FIFO size is between 4 and 128\ MBytes.
As a rule of thumb, the FIFO size should be at least equal to the size
of the internal buffer of the CD/DVD/BluRay-recorder and no more than half of
the physical amount of RAM available in the machine.
If the FIFO size is big enough, the FIFO statistics will print a FIFO
empty count of zero and a FIFO min fill not below 20%.
It is not wise to use too much space for the FIFO. If you need more
than 8 MB to write a CD at a speed less than 20x from an image on a
local file system on an idle machine, your machine is either underpowered,
has hardware problems or is mis-configured.
If you like to write DVDs or to write CDs at higher speed, it makes sense
to use at least 16\ MB for the FIFO.
.sp
On old and small machines, you need to be more careful with the FIFO size.
If your machine has less than 256\ MB of physical RAM, you should not
set up a FIFO size that is more than 32\ MB.
The sun4c architecture (e.g. a Sparcstation-2) has only MMU page table entries
for 16\ MBytes per process. Using more than 14\ MBytes for the FIFO
may cause the operating system in this case to spend much time to constantly
reload the MMU tables. Newer machines from Sun do not have this MMU
hardware problem. The author has no information on PC hardware reflecting
this problem.
.sp
Old Linux systems for non-x86 platforms have broken definitions for
the shared memory size. You need to fix them and rebuild the kernel
or manually tell
.B cdrecord
to use a smaller FIFO.
.sp
If you have buffer underruns or similar problems (like a constantly empty
drive-buffer) and observe a zero
.IR "fifo empty count" ,
you have hardware problems that prevent the data from flowing fast enough
from the kernel memory to the drive. The FIFO size in this case is sufficient,
but you should check for a working DMA setup.
.TP
.BI gracetime= #
Set the grace time before starting to write to
.IR # " seconds.
Values below 3 seconds are not allowed in order to prevent the volume management
from interrupting the write process.
.TP
.B \-ignsize
Ignore the known size of the medium. This option should be used with extreme
care, it exists only for debugging purposes so do not use it for other reasons.
It is not needed to write disks with more than the nominal capacity.
This option implies
.BR \-overburn .
.TP
.B \-immed
Tell cdrecord to set the
.B "SCSI IMMED"
flag in certain commands
(load, eject, blank, close_track, close_session).
This can be useful
on broken systems with ATAPI hard-disk and CD/DVD/BluRay writer on the same bus or
with SCSI systems that do not use disconnect/reconnect.
These systems will freeze while blanking or fixating a CD/DVD/BluRay or while a DVD
writer is filling up a session to the minimum amount (approx. 800 MB).
Setting the
.B \-immed
flag will request the command to return immediately
while the operation proceeds in background, making
the bus usable for the other devices and avoiding the system freeze.
This is an experimental feature which may work or not, depending on the model
of the CD/DVD/BluRay writer.
A correct solution would be to set up a correct cabling but there seem to be 
notebooks around that have been set up the wrong way by the manufacturer.
As it is impossible to fix this problem in notebooks, the
.B \-immed
option has been added.
.sp
A second experimental feature of the
.B \-immed
flag is to tell cdrecord to try to wait short times while writing to the
media. This is expected to free the IDE bus if the CD/DVD/BluRay writer and the
data source are connected to the same IDE cable. In this case, the CD/DVD/BluRay
writer would otherwise usually block the IDE bus for nearly all the time
making it impossible to fetch data from the source drive. See also the
.B minbuf=
and
.B \-v
options.
.sp
Use both features at your own risk.
If it turns out that it would make sense to have a separate option
for the wait feature, write to the author and convince him.
.TP
.B \-inq
Do an inquiry for the drive, print the inquiry info for the drive and exit.
.TP
.B \-load
Load the media and exit. This only works with a tray-loading mechanism
but seems to be useful when using the Kodak disk transporter.
.TP
.B \-lock
Load the media, lock the door and exit. This only works with a tray-loading mechanism
but seems to be useful when using the Kodak disk transporter.
.TP
.BI mcn= med_cat_nr
Set the 
.B "Media Catalog Number
of the CD to 
.IR med_cat_nr .
.TP
.BI minbuf= value
The
.B minbuf=
option allows to define the minimum drive-buffer fill ratio for the
experimental ATAPI wait mode that is intended to free the IDE bus
to allow hard disk and CD/DVD/BluRay writer to be on the same IDE cable.
As the wait mode currently only works when the verbose option
.B \-v
has been specified, 
.B cdrecord
implies the verbose option in case the 
.B \-immed
or
.B minbuf=
option has been specified.
Valid values for 
.B minbuf= 
are between 25 and 95 for 25%.\|.\|.95% minimum drive-buffer fill ratio.
.TP
.B \-media\-info
.TP
.B \-minfo
Retrieve and print information about the state of the medium.
This option currently only works for MMC-compliant drives.
.TP
.B \-msinfo
Retrieve multi-session info in a form suitable for 
.B "mkisofs-1.10" 
or later.
.sp
This option makes only sense with a CD that contains at least
one closed session and is appendable (not finally closed yet). 
Some drives create error messages if you try to get the 
multi-session info for a disk that is not suitable for this 
operation.
.TP
.B \-noclose
Do not close the current track, useful only when in packet writing mode.
This is an experimental interface.
.TP
.B \-nofix
Do not fixate the disk after writing the tracks. This may be used
to create an audio disk in steps. An un-fixated disk can usually not be used
on a non CD-writer type drive but there are audio CD-players that will
be able to play such a disk.
.TP
.B \-overburn
Allow 
.B cdrecord 
to write more than the official size of a medium. This feature is usually
called 
.I overburning
and depends on the fact that most blank media may hold more space than the
official size. As the official size of the lead-out area on the disk is
90 seconds (6750 sectors) and a disk usually works if there are at least
150 sectors of lead out, all media may be overburned by at least 88 seconds
(6600 sectors).
Most CD-recorders only do overburning in 
.B SAO
or
.B RAW
mode. Known exceptions are TEAC CD-R50S, TEAC CD-R55S and the Panasonic
CW-7502.
Some drives do not allow to overburn as much as you might like and limit
the size of a CD to e.g. 76 minutes. This problem may be circumvented by
writing the CD in RAW mode because this way the drive has no chance to find
the size before starting to burn.
There is no guarantee that your drive supports overburning at all.
Make a test to check if your drive implements the feature.
.TP
.B \-packet
Set 
.B "Packet writing mode. 
This is an experimental interface.
.TP
.BR pktsize= #
Set the packet size to #, forces fixed packet mode.
This is an experimental interface.
.TP
.B \-prcap
Print the drive capabilities for SCSI-3/mmc-compliant drives
as obtained from mode page 0x2A. Values marked with 
.I kB
use 1000 bytes as kilo-byte, values marked with
.I KB
use 1024 bytes as Kilo-byte.
.TP
.B \-setdropts
Set the driveropts specified by
.BI driveropts= "option list" ,
the 
.B speed
of the drive and the 
.B dummy
flag and exit.
This allows cdrecord to set drive specific parameters that are not directly 
used by
.B cdrecord
like e.g.
.BR "single session mode" ", " "hide cdr"
and similar.
It is needed in case that 
.BI driveropts= "option list"
should be called without planning to run a typical
.B cdrecord
task.
.TP
.BR speed= #
Set the speed factor of the writing process to #.
# is an integer, representing a multiple of what has been defined as single speed
for the medium.
.sp
For CD-media, single speed is the audio playback speed.
This is about 150\ KB/s for CD-ROM and about 172\ KB/s for CD-Audio.
Single speed is about 1385\ kB/s for DVD media and about 4496\ kB/s for BluRay media.
.sp
If no 
.I speed
option is present,
.B cdrecord
will try to get a drive specific speed value from the file
.B /etc/default/cdrecord
and if it cannot find one, it will try to get the speed value from the
.B CDR_SPEED
environment and later from the 
.B CDR_SPEED=
entry in
.BR /etc/default/cdrecord .
If no speed value could be found, cdrecord uses a drive specific default speed.
The default for all new (MMC-compliant) drives is to use the maximum supported by the drive.
If you use 
.I "speed=0"
with a MMC-compliant drive,
.B cdrecord
will switch to the lowest possible speed for drive and medium.
If you are using an old (non-MMC) drive that has problems with
.I "speed=2" 
or 
.IR "speed=4" , 
you should try 
.IR "speed=0" .
.TP
.B \-text
Write CD-Text information
based on information taken from a file that contains ascii information
for the text strings. 
.B Cdrecord
supports CD-Text information based on the content of the
.B "*.inf
files created by 
.B cdda2wav 
and CD-Text information based on the content from a
.B "CUE sheet
file.
If a 
.B "CUE sheet
file contains both (binary CDTEXTFILE and text based SONGWRITER)
entries, then the information based on the CDTEXTFILE entry will win.
.sp
You need to use the
.B \-useinfo
option in addition in order to tell 
.B cdrecord
to read the
.B "*.inf
files or
.BI cuefile= filename
in order to tell
.B cdrecord
to read a
.B "CUE sheet
file in addition.
If you like to write your own CD-Text information,
edit the
.B "*.inf
files or the
.B "CUE sheet
file with a text editor and change the fields
that are relevant for CD-Text.
.TP
.BI textfile= filename
Write CD-Text based on information found in the binary file
.IR filename .
This file must contain information in a data format defined in the
SCSI-3 MMC-2 standard and in the Red Book. The four-byte-sized header that is 
defined in the SCSI standard is optional and allows to make the recognition of
correct data less ambiguous.
This is the best option to be used to copy CD-Text data from existing CDs
that already carry CD-Text information. To get data in a format suitable
for this option use 
.B cdrecord \-vv \-toc
to extract the information from disk.
If both, 
.BI textfile= filename
and CD-Text information from
.B "*.inf
or
.B "*.cue
files are present,
.BI textfile= filename
will overwrite the other information.
.TP
.B \-toc
Retrieve and print out the table of contents or PMA of a CD.
With this option, 
.B cdrecord
will work with CD-R drives and with CD-ROM drives.
.TP
.B \-waiti
Wait for input to become available on standard input before trying to open
the SCSI driver. This allows 
.B cdrecord
to read its input from a pipe even
when writing additional sessions to a multi-session disk.
When writing another session to a multi-session disk,
.B mkisofs 
needs to read the old session from the device before writing output.
This cannot be done if
.B cdrecord 
opens the SCSI driver at the same time.
.TP
.B \-useinfo
Use
.B "*.inf
files to overwrite audio options.
If this option is used, the pregap size information, 
the index information,
the pre-emphasis information
and the CD-Text information
is read from 
the
.B "*.inf
file that is associated with the file that contains the audio
data for a track.
.sp
If used together with the
.B \-audio
option,
.B cdrecord
may be used to write audio CDs from a pipe from
.B cdda2wav
if you call
.B cdrecord
with the
.B "*.inf
files as track parameter list instead of using audio files.
The audio data is read from 
.B stdin
in this case.
See
.I EXAMPLES
section below.
.B Cdrecord
first verifies that 
.B stdin
is not connected to a terminal and runs some heuristic consistency checks
on the
.B "*.inf
files and then sets the track lengths from the information in
the
.B "*.inf
files.
.sp
If you like to write from 
.BR stdin ,
make sure that cdrecord is called with a large enough FIFO size, reduce the write
speed to a value below the read speed of the source drive and switch the burn-free
option for the recording drive on.

.BI dev= target
Set the SCSI target for the CD/DVD/BluRay-recorder, see notes above.
A typical target device specification is
.BI dev= 1,6,0
\&.
If a filename must be provided together with the numerical target 
specification, the filename is implementation specific.
The correct filename in this case can be found in the system specific
manuals of the target operating system.
On a 
.I FreeBSD

.I CAM
support, you need to use the control device (e.g.
.IR /dev/rcd0.ctl ).
A correct device specification in this case may be
.BI dev= /dev/rcd0.ctl:@
\&.
.sp
.B \h'-2m'General SCSI addressing

The
.I target device
to the 
.B dev=

refers to the
.B SCSI\ CAM
standard notation for
.IR scsibus / target / lun
of the CD/DVD/BluRay-recorder. Communication on 
.I SunOS
is done with the SCSI general driver
.B scg.
Other operating systems are using a library simulation of this driver.
Possible syntax is:
.B dev=
.IR scsibus , target , lun
or
.B dev=
.IR target , lun .
In the latter case, the CD/DVD/BluRay-recorder has to be connected to the default 
SCSI bus of the machine.
.IR Scsibus ,
.I target 
and 
.I lun
are integer numbers. 
Some operating systems or SCSI transport implementations may require to
specify a filename in addition.
In this case the correct syntax for the device is:
.B dev=
.IR devicename : scsibus , target , lun
or
.B dev=
.IR devicename : target , lun .
If the name of the device node that has been specified on such a system
refers to exactly one SCSI device, a shorthand in the form
.B dev=
.IR devicename : @

.IR devicename : @ , lun
may be used instead of
.B dev=
.IR devicename : scsibus , target , lun .

.B \h'-2m'Remote SCSI addressing
.br
To access remote SCSI devices, you need to prepend the SCSI device name by
a remote device indicator. The remote device indicator is either
.BI REMOTE: user@host:

A valid remote SCSI device name may be:
.BI REMOTE: user@host:
to allow remote SCSI bus scanning or
.BI REMOTE: user@host:1,0,0
to access the SCSI device at 
.I host
connected to SCSI bus # 1,target 0, lun 0.

.BR ts= #
Set the maximum transfer size for a single SCSI command to #.
The syntax for the 
.B ts=
option is the same as for cdrecord fs=# or sdd bs=#.
.sp
If no 
.B ts=
option has been specified,
.B cdrecord
defaults to a transfer size of 63\ kB. If libscg gets lower values from the
operating system, the value is reduced to the maximum value that is possible
with the current operating system.
Sometimes, it may help to further reduce the transfer size or to enhance it,
but note that it may take a long time to find a better value by experimenting
with the
.B ts=
option.
.TP
.B \-V
Increment the verbose level in respect of SCSI command transport by one.
This helps to debug problems
during the writing process, that occur in the CD/DVD/BluRay-recorder. 
If you get incomprehensible error messages you should use this flag
to get more detailed output.
.B \-VV

Using
.B \-V
or

slows down the process and may be the reason for a buffer underrun.

.SH "TRACK OPTIONS
.PP
Track options may be mixed with track file names.
.TP
.B \-audio
If this flag is present, all subsequent tracks are written in
.B "CD-DA 
(similar to Red Book) audio format.
The file with data for this tracks should
contain stereo, 16-bit digital audio with 44100 samples/s.
The byte order should be the following: MSB left, LSB left, 
MSB right, LSB right, MSB left and so on. The track should be a multiple of 
2352 bytes. It is not possible to put the master image of an audio track 
on a raw disk because 
data will be read in multiple of 2352 bytes during the recording process.
.sp
If a filename ends in 
.I .au
or
.I .wav
the file is considered to be a structured audio data file.
.B Cdrecord
assumes that the file in this case is a Sun audio file or a
Microsoft .WAV file
and extracts the audio data from the files by skipping over the
non-audio header information.
In all other cases, cdrecord will only work correctly if the
audio data stream does not have any header.
Because many structured audio files do not have an integral
number of blocks (1/75th second each) in length,
it is often necessary to specify the
.B \-pad
option as well.
.B cdrecord
recognizes that audio data in a .WAV file is stored in Intel
(little-endian) byte order, and will automatically byte-swap the data
if the CD-recorder requires big-endian data.  
.B Cdrecord
will reject any audio file that does not match the Red Book requirements
of 16-bit stereo samples in PCM coding at 44100 samples/second.
.sp
Using other structured audio data formats as input to 
.B cdrecord
will usually work if the structure of the data is the 
structure described above (raw pcm data in big-endian byte order).
However, if the data format includes a header,
you will hear a click at the start of the track.
.TP
.I " "
If neither 
.I \-data 
nor
.I \-audio
have been specified, 
.B cdrecord
defaults to 
.I \-audio
for all filenames that end in
.I .au
or 
.I .wav
and to
.I \-data 
for all other files.
.TP
.B \-cdi
If this flag is present, the TOC type for the disk is set to
.BR CDI .
This only makes sense with XA disks.
.TP
.B \-copy
If this flag is present, all TOC entries for subsequent audio tracks
of the resulting CD
will indicate that the audio data has permission to be copied without limit.
This option has no effect on data tracks.
.TP
.B \-data
If this flag is present, all subsequent tracks are written in
.B "CD-ROM mode 1
(Yellow Book) format. The data size is a multiple of 2048 bytes.
The file with track data should contain an 
.BR ISO-9660 " or " "Rock Ridge
filesystem image (see 
.B mkisofs
for more details). If the track data is an
.B ufs
filesystem image, fragment size should be set to 2\ KB or more to allow
CD-drives with 2\ KB sector size to be used for reading.
.TP
.I " "
.I \-data
is the default, if no other flag is present and the file does not
appear to be of one of the well known audio file types.
.TP
.I " "
If neither 
.I \-data 
nor
.I \-audio
have been specified, 
.B cdrecord
defaults to 
.I \-audio
for all filenames that end in
.I .au
or 
.I .wav
and to
.I \-data 
for all other files.
.TP
.BI index= list
Sets an index list for the next track.
In index list is a comma separated list of numbers that are counting
from index 1. The first entry in this list must contain a 0, the following 
numbers must be an ascending list of numbers (counting in 1/75 seconds) that 
represent the start of the indices. An index list in the form:
0,7500,15000 sets index 1 to the start of the track, index 2 100 seconds from
the start of the track and index 3 200 seconds from the start of the track.
.TP
.B \-isosize
Use the 
.B "ISO-9660
file system size as the size of the next track.
This option is needed if you want 
.B cdrecord
to directly read the image of a track from
a raw disk partition or from a 
.I TAO 
master CD. In the first case the option
.B \-isosize
is needed to limit the size of the CD to the size of the ISO filesystem.
In the second case the option
.B \-isosize
is needed to prevent 
.B cdrecord
from reading the two run-out blocks that are appended by each CD-recorder
in track-at-once mode. These two run-out blocks cannot be read and would
cause a buffer underrun that would cause a defective copy.
.sp
Note that if this option is used on files created by 
.BR mkisofs ,
the padding data that was added by
.B mkisofs
is lost and replaced by padding added by cdrecord. 
This may also change the amount of padding.
.sp
In case
.B cdrecord
reads the track data from 
.IR stdin ,
only the first track may be used with the
.B \-isosize
option.
.sp
If 
.B \-isosize
is used for a track, 
.B cdrecord
will automatically add padding for this track as if the
.B \-pad
option had been used but the amount of padding may be less than the padding
written by 
.BR  mkisofs .
Note that if you use
.B \-isosize
on a track that contains Sparc boot information, the boot information will
be lost.
.sp
Note also that
this option cannot be used to determine the size of a file system
if the
.B \-multi
option is present.
.TP
.BI isrc= ISRC_number
Set the 
.B "International Standard Recording Number
for the next track to
.IR ISRC_number .
.TP
.B \-mode2
If this flag is present, all subsequent tracks are written in
.B "CD-ROM mode 2
format. The data size is a multiple of 2336 bytes.
.TP
.B \-nocopy
If this flag is present, all TOC entries for subsequent audio tracks 
of the resulting CD
will indicate that the audio data has permission to be copied only once for
personal use \-
this is the default.
.TP
.B \-nopad
Do not pad the following tracks \- the default.
.TP
.B \-nopreemp
If this flag is present, all TOC entries for subsequent audio tracks 
will indicate that the audio data has been mastered with linear data \- 
this is the default.
.TP
.B \-noshorttrack
Re-enforce the Red Book track length standard. Tracks must be
at least 4 seconds.
.TP
.B \-pad
If the track is a data track, 15 sectors of zeroed data
will be added to the end of this and each subsequent data track.
In this case, the 
.B \-pad 
option is superseded by the 
.B padsize=
option. It will remain however as a shorthand for
.BI padsize= 15s.
If the 
.I \-pad 
option refers to an audio track,
.B cdrecord 
will pad the audio data to be a multiple of 2352 bytes. 
The audio data padding is done with binary zeroes which is 
equal to absolute silence.
.sp
.B \-pad 
remains valid until disabled by 
.BR \-nopad .
.TP
.BR padsize= #
Set the amount of data to be appended as padding to the next track to #.
Opposed to the behavior of the 
.B \-pad
option, the value for 
.I padsize=
is reset to zero for each new track.
Cdrecord assumes a sector size of 2048 bytes for the
.I padsize=
option, independent from the real 
sector size and independent from the write mode.
The megabytes mentioned in the verbose mode output however are counting
the output sector size which is e.g. 2448 bytes when writing in RAW/RAW96
mode.
See the
.BR fs =
option for possible arguments.
To pad the equivalent of 20 minutes on a CD, you may write
.BR padsize= 20x60x75s.
Use this option if your CD-drive is not able to read the last sectors of
a track or if you want to be able to read the CD
on a 
.B Linux 
system with the ISO-9660 filesystem read-ahead bug.
If an empty file is used for track data, 
this option may be used to create a disk that is entirely made of padding.
This may e.g. be used to find out how much overburning is possible with a 
specific medium.
.TP
.B \-preemp
If this flag is present, all TOC entries for subsequent audio tracks 
will indicate that the audio data has been sampled with 50/15 \*msec
pre-emphasis.
The data however is not modified during the process of transferring from file
to disk. 
This option has no effect on data tracks.
.TP
.BR pregap= #
Set the  pre-gap size for the next track.
This option currently only makes sense with the TEAC drive when
creating track-at-once disks without the 2-second silence before each track.
.br
This option may go away in the future. 
.TP
.B \-scms
If this flag is present, all TOC entries for subsequent audio tracks 
of the resulting CD
will indicate that the audio data has no permission to be copied anymore.
.TP
.B \-shorttrack
Allow all subsequent tracks to violate the Red Book track length standard
which requires a minimum track length of 4 seconds.
This option is only useful when used in SAO or RAW mode.
Not all drives support this feature. The drive must accept the
resulting CUE sheet or support RAW writing.
.TP
.B \-swab
If this flag is present, audio data is assumed to be in byte-swapped
(little-endian) order.  Some types of CD-writers e.g. Yamaha, Sony and the
new SCSI-3/mmc drives require audio data to be presented in
little-endian order,
.\" (which is the order in which it's actually recorded on the CD) ????
while other writers require audio data to be
presented in the big-endian (network) byte order normally used by the
SCSI protocol.
.B Cdrecord
knows if a CD-recorder needs audio data in big- or little-endian order,
and corrects the byte order of the data stream to match the needs
of the recorder.
You only need the 
.I \-swab 
flag if your data stream is in Intel (little-endian) byte order.
.sp
Note that the verbose output of
.B cdrecord
will show you if swapping is necessary to make the byte order of 
the input data fit the required byte order of the recorder.
.B Cdrecord
will not show you if the 
.I \-swab 
flag was actually present for a track.
.TP
.BR tsize= #
If the master image for the next track has been stored on a raw disk, 
use this option
to specify the valid amount of data on this disk. If the image of the next 
track is stored in a regular file, the size of that file is taken to determine
the length of this track.
If the track contains an ISO-9660 filesystem image use the 
.I \-isosize
option to determine the length of that filesystem image.
.br
In Disk At Once mode and with some drives that use
the TEAC programming interface, even in Track At Once mode,
.B cdrecord
needs to know the size of each track before starting to write the disk.
Cdrecord now checks this and aborts before starting to write.
If this happens you will need to run
.B "mkisofs \-print\-size
before and use the output (with `s' appended) as an argument to the 
.BR tsize =
option of 
.B cdrecord
(e.g. tsize=250000s).
.br
See
.BR fs =
option for possible arguments.
.TP
.B \-xa
If this flag is present, all subsequent tracks are written in
.B "CD-ROM XA mode 2 form 1
format. The data size is a multiple of 2048 bytes.
The XA sector sub-headers will be created by the drive.
With this option, the write mode is the same as with the
.B \-multi
option.
.TP
.B \-xa1
If this flag is present, all subsequent tracks are written in
.B "CD-ROM XA mode 2 form 1
format. The data size is a multiple of 2056 bytes.
The XA sector sub-headers are part of the user data and have to be
supplied by the application that prepares the data to be written.
.TP
.B \-xa2
If this flag is present, all subsequent tracks are written in
.B "CD-ROM XA mode 2 form 2
format. The data is a multiple of 2324 bytes.
The XA sector sub-headers will be created by the drive.
.TP
.B \-xamix
If this flag is present, all subsequent tracks are written in a way
that allows a mix of 
.B "CD-ROM XA mode 2 form 1/2
format. The data size is a multiple of 2332 bytes.
The XA sector sub-headers are part of the user data and have to be
supplied by the application that prepares the data to be written.
The CRC and the P/Q parity ECC/EDC information (depending on the sector
type) have to be supplied by the application that prepares the data to be written.

Not all options described in this manual may be supported by the OpenSource variant

On Solaris before Solaris 10 Update 1,
you need to stop the volume management if you like to use the USCSI
fallback SCSI transport code. Even things like 
.B "cdrecord -scanbus
will not work if the volume management is running.
.PP
Disks made in 
.B "Track At Once 
mode are not suitable as a master for direct mass production by CD-manufacturers.
You will need the 
.B "disk at once
option to record such disks.
Nevertheless the disks made in
.B "Track At Once 
will normally be read in all CD-players. Some old
audio CD-players however may produce a two second click between two audio tracks.
.PP
The minimal size of a track is 4 seconds or 300 sectors. If you write 
smaller tracks, the CD-recorder will add dummy blocks. This is not an
error, even though the SCSI-error message looks this way.

.B Cdrecord
has been tested on an upgraded Philips CDD-521 recorder at single and 
double speed on a SparcStation 20/502 with no problems, slower computer systems
should work also. 
The newer Philips/HP/Plasmon/Grundig
drives as well as Yamaha CDR-100 and CDR-102 work also. The Plasmon RF-4100
works, but has not been tested in multi-session.
A Philips CDD-521 that has not been upgraded will not work.
The Sony CDU-924 has been tested, but does not support XA-mode2 in hardware.
The Sony therefore cannot create conforming multi-session disks.
The Ricoh RO-1420C works, but some people seem to have problems to 
use them with speed=2, try speed=0 in this case.
.PP
The Yamaha CDR-400 and all new SCSI-3/mmc conforming drives are supported
in single and multi-session.
.PP
You should run several tests in all supported speeds of your drive with the
.B \-dummy
option turned on if you are using 
.B cdrecord
on an unknown system. Writing a CD is a real-time process. 
.B NFS
will not always deliver constantly the needed data rates.
If you want to use 
.B cdrecord 
with CD-images that are located on a

mounted filesystem, be sure that the FIFO size is big enough.
The author used
.B cdrecord 
with medium load on a SS20/502 and even at quad speed 
on a Sparcstation-2 which was heavily loaded, 
but it is recommended to leave the system
as lightly loaded as possible while writing a CD.
If you want to make sure that buffer underruns are not
caused by your source disk, you may use the command
.PP
.B "    cdrecord \-dummy dev=2,0 padsize=600m /dev/null
.PP
to create a disk that is entirely made of dummy data.
.B Cdrecord
needs to run as root to get access to the 
.B /dev/scg?
device nodes and to be able to lock itself into memory.
.PP
If you don't want to allow users to become root on your system,
.B cdrecord
may safely be installed suid root. This allows all users or a group of
users with no root privileges to use 
.B cdrecord.
.B Cdrecord 
in this case checks if the real user would have been able to read 
the specified files.
To give all users access to use 
.B cdrecord, 
enter:
.PP
	chown root /opt/schily/bin/cdrecord
.br
	chmod 4711 /opt/schily/bin/cdrecord
.PP
To give a restricted group of users access to cdrecord enter:
.PP
	chown root /opt/schily/bin/cdrecord
.br
	chgrp cdburners /opt/schily/bin/cdrecord
.br
	chmod 4710 /opt/schily/bin/cdrecord
.PP
and add a group 
.I cdburners
on your system.
.PP
Never give write permissions for non root users to the 
.I /dev/scg?
devices unless you would allow anybody to read/write/format
all your disks.
.PP
You should not connect old drives that do not support
disconnect/reconnect to either the SCSI bus that is connected to the

.PP
A Compact Disc can have no more than 99 tracks.
.PP
When creating a disc with both audio and data tracks, 
the data should be on track 1 otherwise you should create
a CDplus disk which is a multi-session disk with the first session 
containing the audio tracks and the following session containing the data track.

Many operating systems are not able to read more than a single data track, or

The Philips CDD 521 CD-recorder (even in the upgraded version)
has several firmware bugs. Some of them will
force you to power cycle the device or to reboot the machine.
.PP
When using 
.B cdrecord
with the 
.BR "Linux SCSI generic driver" ,
you should note that 
.B cdrecord
uses a layer, that tries to emulate the functionality of the scg driver
on top of the drives of the local operating system.
Unfortunately, the sg driver on 
.B Linux
has several flaws:
.TP
\(bu
It cannot see if a SCSI command could not be sent at all.
.TP
\(bu
It cannot get the SCSI status byte. 
.B Cdrecord
for that reason cannot report failing SCSI commands in some
situations.
.TP
\(bu
It cannot get real DMA count of transfer. 
.B Cdrecord
cannot tell you if there is a DMA residual count.
.TP
\(bu
It cannot get number of bytes valid in auto sense data.
.B Cdrecord
cannot tell you if device transfers no sense data at all.
.TP
\(bu
It fetches too few data in auto request sense (CCS/SCSI-2/SCSI-3 needs >= 18).
.PP
The FIFO percent output is computed just after a block of data has been written
to the CD/DVD/BluRay-recorder. For this reason, there will never be 100% FIFO fill ratio
while the FIFO is in streaming mode.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS

You have 9 seconds to type ^C to abort

The text after the first colon gives the error text for the system call
from the view of the kernel. It usually is:
.B "I/O error
unless other problems happen. The next words contain a short description for
the SCSI command that fails. The rest of the line tells you if there were
any problems for the transport of the command over the SCSI bus.
.B "fatal error
means that it was not possible to transport the command (i.e. no device present
at the requested SCSI address).
.PP
The second line prints the SCSI command descriptor block for the failed command.
.PP
The third line gives information on the SCSI status code returned by the 
command, if the transport of the command succeeds. 
This is error information from the SCSI device.
.PP
The fourth line is a hex dump of the auto request sense information for the 
command.
.PP
The fifth line is the error text for the sense key if available, followed
by the segment number which is only valid if the command was a
.I copy
command. If the error message is not directly related to the current command,
the text
.I deferred error
is appended.
.PP
The sixth line is the error text for the sense code and the sense qualifier if available.
If the type of the device is known, the sense data is decoded from tables
in
.IR scsierrs.c " .
The text is followed by the error value for a field replaceable unit.
.PP
The seventh line prints the block number that is related to the failed command
and text for several error flags. The block number may not be valid.
.PP
The eighth line reports the timeout set up for this command and the time
that the command really needed to complete.
.PP
The following message is not an error:

It simply notifies that a track that is smaller than the minimum size has been
expanded to 300 sectors.
.SH BUGS
.PP
.B Cdrecord
has even more options than 
.BR ls .
.PP
There should be a recover option to make disks usable, that have been written
during a power failure.

.SH "INTERFACE STABILITY
The interfaces provided by 
.B cdrecord
are designed for long term stability.
As
.B cdrecord
depends on interfaces provided by the underlying operating system,
the stability of the interfaces offered by
.B cdrecord
depends on the interface stability of the OS interfaces. 
Modified interfaces in the OS may enforce modified interfaces
in 
.BR cdrecord .
