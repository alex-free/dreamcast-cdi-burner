To learn how to compile and install cdrecord, read README.compile

To compile on currently unknown platforms you definitely need 'smake'
from https://sourceforge.net/projects/s-make/files/ or
https://sourceforge.net/projects/schilytools/files/
GNUmake is too dumb to do this job as it does not include automake features
like 'smake' does.

For multi session please read README.multi

In general, it is a good idea to read all README's and check whether
they may apply for your needs/problems.

Cdrecord runs without problems on a loaded Solaris system.
On Solaris, cdrecord uses the SVr4 priocntl() call to establish
SVr4 real-time scheduling which grants to run cdrecord in a even higher
priority than all kernel processes. On system that provide POSIX real-time
scheduling the result may be slightly worse as not all POSIX RT implementations
grant decent real time behaviour.

The cdrtools distribution contains a SCSI user level transport library
called libscg. The SCSI library is suitable to talk to any SCSI device without
having a special device specific driver for it.
Cdrecord may be easily ported to any system that has a generic SCSI device
driver similar to the scg driver.

On SunOS/Solaris:
You *need* the SCSI general driver 'scg' in order to run cdrecord.

SunOS 4.1.3 only:
	The 'scg' driver is Copyright 1986-1995 Jörg Schilling,
	it is supplied binary in a loadable format.
	There is no future support, there is no non loadable support.

Solaris only:
	The 'scg' driver is Copyright 1986-1995 Jörg Schilling,
	it is supplied binary in pkgadd(1m) format and is tested 
	on Solaris 2.3, Solaris 2.4 & Solaris 2.5 (sparc).

Solaris only:
	It is _nice to have_ the 'fbk' driver to mount files that contain 
	images of file systems. Fbk means File simulates Block Device.

	The 'fbk' driver is Copyright 1988-1995 Jörg Schilling,
	it is supplied binary in pkgadd(1m) format and is tested
	on Solaris 2.3, Solaris 2.4 & Solaris 2.5 (sparc).

On other OS, libscg uses the SCSI drivers that are present on the system.

Cdrecord-1.3 or later adopts the right BUF_SIZE for each architecture.
This is to reduce some performance problems on Solaris x86.
It may be that the reason for this performance problems is that
the PC-architecture has no IO-MMU and therefore is not able to do DVMA.
If this points out to be the reason, I have to
change the scg driver & cdrecord, but this would 
be needed on Linux anyway.

Cdrecord is currently maintained with the following drives:

It should run also on:

	All SCSI-3/mmc compliant drives
	All ATAPI/mmc compliant drives

	NOTE:

	It seems that all drives that have been initially released in 1999
	or later are MMC compliant. If a recent drive does not work with
	cdrecord, you most likely found a firmware bug in this drive.
	Contact your drive vendor in this case.

Multi-session has not been tested with the Plasmon RF-4100

All companies that support me with SCSI command reference manuals and drives
will get (continued) support in the following releases.

The following drives will never be supported by cdrecord because they are too old:

	JVC XR-W1001
	Pinnacle Micro RCD-202
	Ricoh RS-9200CD

The following drives are currently not supported because I don't get specs:
(some of them may partially work: see above)

	Creative Labs CDR 4210
	JVC XR-W2001
	JVC XR-W2010
	JVC XR-W2020
	Pinnacle Micro RCD-1000
	Pinnacle Micro RCD-5020
	Pinnacle Micro RCD-5040
	Plasmon CDR-4240
	Sony CDW-900E

The following drives may get support soon (If I get time to do so):

	Panasonic CW-7501
	Ricoh RS-1060C

If you understang German, it makes sense to have a look at http://www.dchlb.de/
and http://www.brennmeister.com/ for additional information.

To install get:

Solaris only:
	SCHILYscg.sparc.tar.Z	The scg driver in pkgadd format (sparc).
	SCHILYfbk.sparc.tar.Z	The fbk driver in pkgadd format (sparc).
	SCHILYscg.i386.tar.Z	The scg driver in pkgadd format (x86).
	SCHILYfbk.i386.tar.Z	The fbk driver in pkgadd format (x86).

Note that the fbk driver packet is for Solaris 2.4 and not system independent.

All Systems:
	cdrtools-2.0.tar.gz	The cdrtools for source distribution.

NOTE:	All these tar archives are 100% ansi compatible. Solaris 2.x tar and GNU
	tar may get some minor trouble.

WARNING: Do not use 'mc' to extract the tar file!
	All mc versions before 4.0.14 cannot extract symbolic links correctly.

To unpack the archive use:

		gzip -d < cdrtools-2.0.tar.gz | tar -xpf -

	Replace 'cdrtools-2.0' by the actual archive name.

	If your Platform does not support hard links or symbolic links, you
	first need to compile "star" and then call:

		star -xpz -copy-links < cdrtools-2.0.tar.gz

	If your platform does not support hard links but supports
	symbolic links, you only need to call the command above once.
	If your platform does not support symbolic links, you need to call
	the command twice because a symbolic link may occur in the archive
	before the file it points to.
		




The files are located on:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/cdrtools/files/ ...
https://sourceforge.net/projects/schilytools/files/kernel/scg/ ...
https://sourceforge.net/projects/schilytools/files/kernel/fbk/ ...

Only use the mkisofs that is contained in this release.
All other mkisofs versions are too buggy.


Installation Process:

Solaris only:
	1) scg driver
			untar SCHILYscg.tar:
			su
			Password: xxxxx
			cd /tmp
			zcat SCHILYscg.tar | tar -xvf -
			pkgadd -d .
			reboot -- -r 

	2) fbk driver
			similar to scg driver (see above)

	3) Switch the CD-Writer to an unused target id (2 should do it)
		

NOTE:
	Be very careful. pkgadd does not check for the right target 
	architecture. Do not install drivers for intel on sparc
	and vice versa. You will get a corrupt system.

	You need to be root because you need access to /dev/scg? and to be
	able to put cdrecord into the real-time scheduling class.

All Systems:

The SCSI transport library has been taken from the sformat program.
Sformat is the first SCSI disk formatting/analyzing/repairing that runs on
SunOS/Solaris. The first release of sformat has been made for SunOS 3.0
(two years before Sun introduced their format utility). Sformat source
including 10 years of competence in SCSI disk handling is available
on:
	https://sourceforge.net/projects/schilytools/files/sformat/
	https://sourceforge.net/projects/schilytools/files/schily-*

I am interested to hear if someone is interested in a kernel based
filesystem for Solaris that uses packet writing on the CD-Recorder.
The filesystem will create a single session CD that may be finally converted
to a hybrid filesystem that allows to be read as 
ISO-9660 with Rock Ridge extensions too.
Please mail suggestions to: wofs@schily.isdn.cs.tu-berlin.de

If you want to use the CD-recorder as CD-ROM device, have a look at 

Solaris only:
