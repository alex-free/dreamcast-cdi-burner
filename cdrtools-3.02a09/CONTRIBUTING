# @(#)CONTRIBUTING	1.4 14/12/03 Copyright 2006 J. Schilling

If you like to send patches or code to add to the project, you are welcome.

Before you send code or patches, please make sure that the following
requirements apply to your code:

§1	Your code does not duplicate existing functionality

§2	Integrating your code does not take more time than it would
	take to write it from scratch

§3	Your code is cleanly written, is byteorder independent and
	does compile on all supported platforms

§4	Your code does not cause this project to break or otherwise
	fail on one of the supported platforms

§5	Your code does not rely on a specific compiler

§6	Your code is cleanly indented (matches the coding style 
	from "Cstyle"). See files:

		http://sf.net/projects/schilytools/files/cstyle/Cstyle
	and
		http://sf.net/projects/schilytools/files/cstyle/cstyle

§7	You allow me to publish the code under any OSI approved
	license (see http://www.opensource.org/). If you like to
	see your code under a specific license and this license
	grants less freedom than the CDDL, there is little chance
	to integrate your code.

§8	Include not only the code patches but also include the related
	extensions to the man pages.

§9	If you like to make a bigger contribution, provide white papers
	and other documentation that allows to understand your patch
	within a reasonable amount of time.

Pleae note for §7: Licenses may not last forever and it may sometimes
be apropriate to change the license. In case that contributors did
insist in a specific license when contributing and are no longer
reachable via mail, this undertaking may be impossible and kill the 
future of the project. So please help with your contributing to ensure
the future of this project.
